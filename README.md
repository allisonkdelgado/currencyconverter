# currencyconverter
yay 
# The FP work we're choosing to do is a currency converter where our subtask we're choosing as our final project is budget comparison logic where our code should take our home budget, converts it to the local currency, and then provides the user with a "relative" cost feel (for example instead of using the conversion rate set by a rank, depending on user input (3 choices) a different 'relative' conversion rate will be outputted to encourage user frugality)
